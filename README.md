## 🧠 About Me

I'm a Python developer and AI enthusiast currently pursuing Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning. My work focuses on applying NLP, time series analysis, and LLMs to real-world problems — from distress detection in audio to chatbot interactions and voice-based query systems.

I'm passionate about contributing to data-driven products, especially those that blend machine intelligence with user experience, like predictive maintenance, smart assistants, and automation.
